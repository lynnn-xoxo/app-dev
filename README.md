# My Favorite Anime

My favorite anime is *One Piece*. The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy—a young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating the Gum-Gum Fruit—who sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece", and take over his prior title. Here's why I love it:

- **Focuses on dreams**
- **Have moral lessons**
- Great characters like Luffy

I highly recommend it if you haven't seen it yet!
